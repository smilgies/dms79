<br>(* These problems are more advanced.)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Lecture A: X-ray interaction with matter and Fresnel reflectivity
<p>problem 1: X-ray refraction
<p>Calculate the deflection angle of 10keV x-rays passing through a Be
prism as a function of the apex angle.
<br>What is the deflection for an apex angle of 90deg? How does the deflection
compare to the deflection in an
<br>optical prism with n=1.5 and 1eV photons?
<p>* Can you use the deflection in a prism to build an x-ray focussing
device? How wouls that work?
<p>What is the focal length of a Be lens consisting of a 1mm hole in the
center or a 1.2mm thick block of Be?
<br>How many lenses does it take achieve a focal length of 10m for a 10
keV beam ? What is the transmission
<br>of the lens array at its center ?
<p>problem 2: Standing waves in reflectivity
<p>Use the Fresnel theory to determine the electric field at the interface.
What is the field amplitude like in air
<br>and inside the material (10 keV photons, Si substrate)? What is the
period of the field, when the incident angle
<br>is 0.5 ac, ac, and 1.5 ac
<p>* What is the difference in reflectivity for s and p-polarization of
the photon beam?
<p>* Calculate the Fresnel reflectivity for a ferromagnetic material like
Fe. What is the difference between simple
<br>charge scattering (m=1) and magnetic scattering (m=1000).

<p>Lecture B: Matrix formalism and applications
<p>problem 1: Free-standing films
<p>Freestanding films of soap or liquid crystals can be made down to thicknesses
of 50-100A. Using the matrix formalism,
<br>calculate the reflectivity and transmissivity of a 100A soap film (n=1-1e-5)
with 10 keV photons. Is it better to study
<br>the film in reflectivity or in transmittivity? Explain your reasoning.
<p>problem 2: X-ray wave guides
<p>Let's build an x-ray wave guide: substrate is Si, guiding layer some
polymer like Kapton (n=1-1e-5), top layer again Si.
<br>Calculate approximately (assume that the field has a node at the interfaces),
what the thickness of the guiding layer has to be to guide the lowest order
mode at 10keV, when your incident angle is 1.5 ac the top layer. Calculate
the reflectivity using
<br>the CXRO web site, using a top layer thickness of 1/10 of the guiding
layer - how do the waveguide modes show up?
