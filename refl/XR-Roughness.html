<p><b><font size="+2">Roughness in Specular Reflectivity</font></b></p>
</center>
<p>Depending on the wavelength range of their Fourier components, two
types
of roughness are to be distinguished:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
If the roughness period is large compared to the coherence length, we
talk
about macroscopic roughness.</li>
  <li>
If the roughness is small compared to the coherence length, we talk
about
microscopic or atomic roughness.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
Macroscopic roughness is due to facets wider than the coherence
length, oriented at various angles to the x-ray beam. The symptom of
macroscopic
roughness is a specular reflection broader than the resolution function
of the instrument (as determined by the angular width of the direct
beam)
or even split peaks. For x-ray mirrors this type of roughness is called
slope error. Since the incident angle for such samples is not
well-defined,
a quantitative description of such samples is often problematic.
</p>
<p>Microscopic or atomic roughness is on a much smaller scale than the
coherence length and hence describes distortions of the wavefront of
the
incident wave yielding a reduction of the intensity of the scattered
beam
as compared to an ideal interface. Since in specular reflectivity the
lateral
component of the scattering vector is zero, we only have to deal with
the
laterally averaged roughness and not with the detailed shape of the
surface
defects (point defects, steps, islands, ...). An often used assumption
is that the surface height function obeys a Gaussian distribution,
which
leads to a laterally averaged density with the shape of the error
function.
</p>
<p>One of the earliest descriptions of roughness we find in Lord
Rayleigh's
treatment of the reflection of acoustic waves from a hard corrugated
wall.
In this case the ideal reflectivity is multiplied with an exponential
damping
factor
</p>
<blockquote>R<sub>R</sub>(q) = R<sub>F</sub>(q)* exp(-<span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sigma;</span><sup>2</sup>q<sup>2</sup>)</blockquote>
were R<sub>F</sub> is the Fresnel reflectivity and &amp;sigma;
is the root mean square roughness (r.m.s. roughness) of the interface.
<p>This description has some flaws: It cannot be extended easily to the
case of multiple layers other than that the same roughness is assumed
for
each interface or some effective roughness which is some kind of mean
of
the various interface roughnesses. Even worse, the Rayleigh model is
not
good below and in the vicinity of the critical angle. This can be seen
if the Rayleigh model is compared to a discrete roughness model, where
the laterally-averaged density is approximated by thin discrete slabs
and
then treated exactly with the matrix method.

</p>
<p>The most succesful roughness model so far has been proposed by Nevot
and Croce [1], and mathematically analyzed by Vidal and Vincent [2]. We
will refer to it as the NCVV model. In this model, each element of the
interface matrix in the matrix method is multiplied by a factor
</p>
<blockquote>(A<sup>i,i+1,rough</sup>)<sub>j,k</sub> = (A<sup>i,i+1</sup>)<sub>j,k</sub>&nbsp;
exp{-&sigma;<sup>2</sup> [Re(k<sub>z,i</sub> - (-1)<sup>j+k</sup>

k<sub>z,i+1</sub>)]<sup>2</sup> / 2}</blockquote>
where the factor (-1)<sup>j+k</sup> yields the correct sign. For the
reflectivity from a rough interface, this ansatz provides the formula<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
R<sub>VV</sub> = R<sub>F</sub> * exp(-4 <span style="font-family: symbol;">&sigma;</span><sup>2</sup> k<sub>z</sub> Re(k'<sub>z</sub>))<br>
</div>
<p><br>
This model compares well with the discrete model. Since the roughness
factors are specific to each interface, a detailed description of a
multilayer
system can be given. Furthermore, the laterally-averaged density can be
derived with a specific error function for each interface, as for
instance
in the program PARRAT32. Discrete model, Rayleigh model, and NCVV model
are compared below.

R: discrete roughness model with 50 slabs, RF: Fresnel reflectivity
from
an ideal surface, RR: simple Rayleigh model, RVV Vidal-Vincent theory.
RR follows closely the RVV model beyond the critical angle. However the
Rayleigh model RR is not useful below the and in the vicinity of the
critical angle. The discrete model yields results
closely
to RVV, but breaks down at about k<sub>z0 </sub>&gt; 0.075&Aring;<sup>-1</sup> due to its discreet nature.</i> <br>

RR yields
a bad description below the critical angle. The discrete model and RVV
