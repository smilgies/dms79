</p><p>Our calculation of the Fresnel coefficients actually contains the full
information on the wave field, since the full phase information is included.
Since incident and reflected wave have a well-defined phase relation and
are of similar amplitude close to the critical angle, the two wave fields
form a standing wave above the interface:
</p>
<blockquote><b>E</b>(<b>r</b>,t) = <b>E</b><sub>0</sub> exp(-i<span style="font-family: Symbol;">&omega;</span>t)
{ exp(i<b>kr</b>) + r exp(-i<b>kr</b>) }</blockquote>
Inside the medium the wave field is given by
<blockquote><b>E</b>(<b>r</b>,t) = <b>E</b><sub>0</sub> exp(-i<span style="font-family: Symbol;">&omega;</span>t)
{ t exp(i<b>kr</b>) }</blockquote>
and the boundary conditions ensure continuity of the fields at the interface.
If we plot the amplitude of the field as a function of the distance z from
the interface, and vary the incident angle <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&amp;alpha;</span>/<font face="Symbol">&amp;alpha;</font><sub>c</sub>,
we see how the field maxima shift:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="standing-waves.gif" height="300" width="700"></blockquote>
</blockquote>
The figure shows the amplitude of the electric field as a function of <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&alpha;</span>/<span style="font-family: Symbol;">&alpha;</span><sub>c</sub>
and the distance from the interface z.
<br>For <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&alpha;</span>/<span style="font-family: Symbol;">&alpha;</span><sub>c </sub>&lt; 1 the maximum field amplitude is close to 2: incident and totally
reflected wave are in phase. For <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&alpha;</span>/<span style="font-family: Symbol;">&alpha;</span><sub>c</sub><sub></sub>
&gt; 1 there
<br>are still some modulations of the amplitude, but it does not get close
to zero any more: the reflected wave gets weaker and weaker. On the other
hand, the incident wave is not totally reflected any more and penetrates
deeper into the medium.
<p>If one medium contains some trace atoms at a well-defined distance from
the interface with a certain fluorescent yield, then depending on the phase
of the standing wave the fluorescent intensity will vary, as the incident
wave vector is scanned across the critical angle. This effect was demonstrated
by Mike Bedzyk and co-workers at CHESS [M. Bedzyk et al., PRL 62, 1376
(1989)]. They used a Langmuir-Blodgett film of several double layers. One
of the layers contained zinc counter ions. The fluorescent yield is directly
proportional to the electric field of the standing wave. This effect can
be utilized to characterize concentration profiles of trace elements within
a layer above an interface.
