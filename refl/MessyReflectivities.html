Thicker organic films, i.e. between 100 nm and 1000 nm, are often very
rough. Can we still learn something about such films when there are no
mor Kiessig fringes, be it that they are damped out by the Roughness,
be it that they are smeared out by the finite resolution? The answer is
yes, if we look carefully at the critical angles. If&nbsp; we crank up
the roughness, the following will happen:<br>

<ul>

  <li>first the Kiessig fringes disappear </li>
  <li>then the resonances between the critical angles will disappear </li>
</ul>

When we still have the wave guide resonances we proceed as follows<br>

<ul>

  <li>we determine the critical angle of the film. From this we get the
average film density, if the chemical composition of the film is known.
  </li>
  <li>we vary the thickness until the number and location of the
resonances is reproduced </li>
  <li>we fit the roughness for overall good agreement </li>
</ul>

Step 2 and 3 may have to be iterated.<br>

<br>

<br>

Can we still learn something about the film when we do not see the
resonances any more? Yes, is the answer, if we proceed this way:<br>

<ul>

  <li>again we fit the film critical angle and get an estimate for the density </li>
  <li>if the stoechiometry is known, we get both optical parameters &delta; and &beta;<br>
  </li>
  <li>we fit the thicknes to reproduce the attenuation of the
reflectivity at the critical
angle of the substrate </li>
  <li>we fit the rounding off at the film critical angle and the
initial dip to get
the roughness </li>
</ul>

Now, we have to be a bit careful not to leave the validity of the NCVV
roughness model - as long as s is small than 10% of the thickness we
should be fine. For a 3000 &Aring; film this actually means that we can model
huge roughnesses of up to 300 &Aring;!<br>
