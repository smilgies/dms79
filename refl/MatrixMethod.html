<p>A typical application of a reflectivity measurement is, if we have a
thin
film on a substrate. Now we have to deal with two interfaces, air-film and film-substrate. We expect that
the
reflected wave from both interfaces interfere with each other and give rise to Kiessig fringes, from which
the
thickness of the film can be determined with high precision. We will
treat
the most general case now where we have n interfaces and the goal is,
to
understand how to solve the system of 2N boundary conditions. <br>

Within each region i we have a wave vector k<sub>z,i</sub> as given by
the
local index of refraction, and amplitudes a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub>
of the incident and the reflected waves, respectively. For the
interface between
layer i and layer i+1 at a distance z<sub>i,i+1</sub> from the top
surface
at z<sub>0,1</sub>=0 and wave vectors k<sub>z,i+1</sub> and k<sub>z,i</sub>
on either side of the boundary, we get the following boundary condition
for
the wave amplitudes: </p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<sub>i</sub> exp(i k<sub>z,i</sub>
z<sub>i,i+1</sub>)&nbsp;
&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b<sub>i</sub> exp(-i k<sub>z,i</sub>
z<sub>i,i+1</sub>)&nbsp;
=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<sub>i+1</sub>
exp(i k<sub>z,i+1</sub> z<sub>i,i+1</sub>)&nbsp;
&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; b<sub>i+1
  </sub>exp(-i k<sub>z,i+1</sub> z<sub>i,i+1</sub>) <br>
k<sub>z,i</sub> a<sub>i</sub> exp(i k<sub>z,i</sub> z<sub>i,i+1</sub>)&nbsp;
-&nbsp; k<sub>z,i</sub> b<sub>i</sub> exp(-i k<sub>z,i</sub> z<sub>i,i+1</sub>)&nbsp;
=&nbsp; k<sub>z,i+1</sub> a<sub>i+1</sub> exp(i k<sub>z,i+1</sub> z<sub>i,i+1</sub>)&nbsp;
-&nbsp; k<sub>z,i+1</sub> b<sub>i+1</sub> exp(-i k<sub>z,i+1</sub> z<sub>i,i+1</sub>)</blockquote>

and with some re-arranging
<blockquote>a<sub>i</sub> = A<sub>i,i+1,11</sub> a<sub>i+1</sub> + A<sub>i,i+1,12</sub>
b<sub>i+1</sub> <br>
b<sub>i</sub> = A<sub>i,i+1,21</sub> a<sub>i+1</sub> + A<sub>i,i+1,22</sub>
b<sub>i+1</sub></blockquote>

i.e. the transfer matrix <b>A</b><sub>i,i+1</sub> relates the fields
on either
side of the interface i,i+1.
<p><font color="#cc0000">homework: calculate the components of the
2&times;2 matrix <b>A</b><sub>i,i+1</sub></font> </p>

<p>For the whole stack of N layers we thus get </p>

<blockquote>(a<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>0</sub>) = <b>A</b><sub>0,1</sub> <b>A</b><sub>1,2</sub>
...&nbsp; A<sub>i,i+1</sub> ... <b>A</b><sub>N-1,N</sub> (a<sub>N</sub>,
b<sub>N</sub>)
= <b>A</b> (a<sub>N</sub>, b<sub>N</sub>)</blockquote>

a<sub>0</sub>,b<sub>0</sub> and a<sub>N</sub>,b<sub>N</sub> are
special: a<sub>0</sub> is just the incident wave onto the sample, b<sub>0</sub>
yields
the reflectivity signal we <br>

observe:
<blockquote>a<sub>0</sub> = 1 <br>
b<sub>0</sub> = r</blockquote>

We assume an infinitely thick substrate, so there is no reflected wave
in
layer N:
<blockquote>b<sub>N</sub> = 0</blockquote>

and a<sub>N</sub> is the transmitted wave into the substrate. Hence
we&nbsp; arrive at
<blockquote>(1, r) = <b>A</b> (t, 0)</blockquote>

which can be easily solved now for r and t
<blockquote>t = 1 / <b>A</b><sub>11</sub> <br>
r = <b>A</b><sub>21</sub> / <b>A</b><sub>11</sub></blockquote>

We see that the general case involves more or less the same amount of
calculation as the special cases of one or two layers. The outlined algorithm is known as the "matrix method"
and
is the algorithm mostly used these days. <br><br>
History: Parratt at Cornell devised a similar algorithm [L.G. Parratt, Phys.
Rev.
B95, 359 (1954)] , which became very popular, in connection with
Parrat's seminal papers on experimental applications of reflectivity. The matrix method
is actually a couple of years older than Parratt's algorithm and was
first published by
F. Abel&egrave;s [Ann. Physique (Paris) 5, 596 (1950)]. Similar schemes were
already known in visible optics and spectroscopy - I know of an example
in
Max Born, Optik (1924), the predecessor of the classic optics book by
Born
and Wolf.
<p>Note, that the matrix formalism has a direct analogon in quantum
mechanics, namely reflection and transmission of a particle wave at a
potential step or barrier (tunnel effect!). The requirement of
continuity of the wave function &psi; and its derivative at the
potential step gives
rise to the same boundary conditions as above. With respect to
application
in scattering, the quantum mechanical case is of importance for
reflectivity
studies with neutron beams. <br>
