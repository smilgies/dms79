<h1 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">D1
Film Thickness Monitor</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Detlef
Smilgies, CHESS</h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Film thickness monitor</h3>
The in-situ sample chamber at D1 can be equipped with a FilMetrics F30
spectroscopic reflectometer. Thickness between 10 nm and several
microns can be detected and monitored during data acquisition. Film spectra can by synchronized with X-ray
images.<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Starting the monitor</h3>
The thickness monitor and the Windows&nbsp;controll computer are
inside the hutch with a remote terminal, mouse and keyboard.
Double-click "scroll lock" switch, if the monitor does not show the
usual XP desktop. The FilMetrics controller has to be powered on and
connected to the computer, before the data acquisition software can be
started.<br>
<br>
Double-click the FilMetrics icon to start the Acquisition program
FilMeasure. In this mode single spectra can be acquired and fit ted at arbitrary times, or the software
can be set-up in permanent monitring mode including automated fitting
of spectra.<br>
<br>
Quick Start:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>First step is calibration of the spectrometer using the
"Baseline" button. For this a clean silicon wafer piece is placed in
the beam and the reflectance is measured (first click). Afterwards the
wafer is removed and replaced by a mirror to measure the background
(second click)</li>
  <li>Using the "Measure" button, a reflectance curve is measured and fitted.</li>
  <li>Using "Edit structure" the fitting model can be defined /
redefined (number of layers, start initial thickness, n,k, roughness,
free or fixed parameter).</li>
  <li>Using "ReAnalyze" the measured spectrum is refitted.</li>
  <li>Using "Acquire &gt; Start continuous measure" from the menu
contibuous acquisition is started. Note that the computer will be very
busy now and should be left alone. Moving the mouse back to "Acquire
&gt; Stop continuous measure", acquisition can be stopped. Please be
patient to wait for the menu to drop and the computer to react,
otherwise you risk crashing the program and loosing data.</li>
  <li>After continuous aquisition data can be viewed using the "show
statistics" button. Film thickness versus time is the primary
information. Goodness of fit (GoF) can be used to diagnose whether the
film was stable (reflectance &gt; 30%) or dewetted (&lt;10%). Any jump
in GoF indicates something is going on. Individual spectra are stored
in memory, and can be recalled by clicking the corresponding row in the
table. </li>
  <li>Individual spectra can be saved using File &gt; Save Measured
Spectrum and File &gt; Save calculated Spectrum. For automatic saving
of spectro see next section.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Synchronizing
spectra with images</span></h3>In
synchronized mode the VB6 script "Data Acquirer" (start as Dline.exe on
Marvin's directory) by Marvin Paik can
be started, when monitor and FilMeasure are already running. The script
will look for a command file generated by spec and collect and save a
spectrum in the FilMetrics directory on the station computer, whenever
the command file appears. The spectrum will have the same filename as
the
associated image.<br>
<br>
Program inputs:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Input directory (omit final '\')&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; H:\FilMetrics</span></li>
  <li>Input filename (incluse ext.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; fmnames</span></li>
  <li>Delay
(secs)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</span></li>
  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;"> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start / Stop</span></li>
</ul>
Notes: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Delay controls, how often the program looks for a new file. 1 sec
is typical for synchronizing with the MedOptics detector (3-4 sec
read-out). Minimum is about 0.1 sec.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">Start/Stop</span> enable/disable the synchronize spectrum acqusition and saving.</li>
</ul>
