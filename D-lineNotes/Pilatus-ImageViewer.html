<h1 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 204, 51);">Pilatus
ImageViewer (PilView)<br>
</h1>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The Pilatus image viewer, in short
PilView, is a small Scilab program to view and edit file series
obtained with the CHESS Pilatus 100k detector.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> Currently only the vertical mode is
supported, with the long axis of the detector vertical.<br>
</span>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Scilab installation</span></h2>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Scilab can be downloaded for free
from www.scilab.org. The program needs the current stable version&nbsp;
5.3.3. I run Scilab under Windows 7 in 64-bit mode on a dual core
processor (2.9 GHz). The program will also run on smaller computers
including my EEE PC netbook under XP, but naturally at slower speed.</span> <br>

<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Running PilView<br>
</h2>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Scilab 5.3.3. has a little glitch
in that it does not set the default directory automatically when you
click the PilView icon. Go to the Console and use
File&gt;ChangeCurrentDirectory to the directory where PilView.sce is
kept on your computer. In this directory also the subroutines *.sci are
kept that the program needs. Load PilView in the editor (this happens
automatically if you doubleclick the PilView icon) and execute the
program using Ctrl-Shift-E. The "Pilatus ImageViewer" window should
appear.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The program window is made for a
large terminal, so for use on a netbook the size should be reset. If
you feel inclined to hack the code, please copy it to a different
folder, so that the general user version is left on the dropbox - this
way I can work on erors, and everybody get the benefit of the fix.</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><br>Now to the program feature: Before you load a "new" file series to watch the movie, make your
choices:<br>
</span>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">

  <li>if "movie" is checked, the progam will ask for first and last
file and display the file series on the screen at highest speed</li>
  <ul>
    <li>there is no checking yet whether first and last file are of the
same series - PilView uses the last filename to generate the fileseries<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>if "movie" is unchecked, the program will display single snap
shots</li>
  <ul>
    <li>useful to inspect test shots, single shots, or go at random
through a file series to look for an event&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>if "convert" is checked, the program will produce png output for
each file, using the same name but the .png extension</li>
  <ul>
    <li>I found that png provided the highest quality output<br>
    </li>
    <li>it is good to play with the other settings first, to make a
nice movie - keep reading!<br>
    </li>
    <li>I like Windows 7 MovieMaker to generate movies from series of
png files. <br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The MovieMaker can be downloaded for free from Windows Life</li>
      <ul>
        <li>http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker<br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>It's similar to the XP movie maker, but saves a lot of
clicks!&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>if "folder" is clicked, the name of the file folder is displayer
in the top left corner, and also part of the png image</li>
  <ul>
    <li>make sure you use useful folder names from which the sample can
be identified</li>
  </ul>
  <li>if "number" is clicked, the filenumber is displayed</li>
  <li>the bottom row of number inputs helps to make images look nice
and to let movies run efficiently<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>"max" sets the maximum intensity (default value 100).<br>
    </li>
    <li>"min" produces a small offset to brighten up the background, if
desired (default value 0).</li>
    <li>"skip" allows to skip n frames. in case a longer file series is
to be inspected</li>
    <ul>
      <li>example: if skip=3 and first file is ~00001, PilView will
display files ~00001, ~00004, ~00007,...</li>
    </ul>
    <li>so far only the linear scale is supported<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>"new" starts a new session, according to the choices above.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"new" will open the file input dialog<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>PilView will keep loading movies or snaps, until you say
"Cancel" or "x" on the "open file" window</li>
    <li>the above parameters can only be reset when you stop opening
files</li>
    <ul>
      <li>note: changes become active, when you plot the next batch of files<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>another click on "new" gets the program to continue reading files<br>
</li>
    <li>NOTE: this program is written to crank it - no time wasted on
niceties!</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
