CHESS</h2><h3 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">the "more than you ever wanted to know" page</h3><br>The D1 area detector (MedOptics) is a fibercoupled CCD camera <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
i.e. there is an optical fiber bundle connecting the fluorescent
screen (that coverts x-rays into optical light) to the CCD chip - thats's
the same electronic device capturing the
images  as in your digital camera <br></div>
<br>
with a pixel size of 46.9 microns x 46.9 microns <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">note: this value was obtained recently when we recalibrated the
camera (Oct. 2007). The value from the previous calibration was 47.2
microns. Since we modified the image correction mode a bit to the
current state of the art, this small correction of less than 1% is reasonable. However,
to be self-consistent, the images before re-calibration should be
evaluated using the old pixel size.<br></div>
<br>
and a total of 1024 x 1024 pixels with a 14-bit dynamical range per
pixel.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
i.e. min value is 1, max value per pixel is 16,383.<br></div>
<br>
Typical read-out time per image is below 5 sec.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The read-out time&nbsp; may be further
reduced using 2x2 (about 3 sec) or 4x4 binning (about 2 sec) at the cost of lower resolution. <br></div>
<br>
The images are background corrected, <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
the read-out noise level is about 200 units <br></div>
<br>
distortion-corrected, <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
to account for imperfections in the fiber optics bundle<br></div>
<br>
and flat-field corrected.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
accounting for variation in sensitivity of the fluorescent screen
and the pixels in the CCD <br></div>
<br>
A pedestal value of 20 was added to the images to avoid negative
values. <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">recommended viewing range in fit2d is 15 to 15,000 (log scale)</div>
