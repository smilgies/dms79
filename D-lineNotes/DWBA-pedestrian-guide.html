<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Distorted Wave Born Approximation
(DWBA) is already quite a mouthful as a term, let alone the 4-letter
abbreviation. Here a brief introduction to basic ideas shall be given.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Let's take a brief look at the
Born approximation, the standard scattering theory. In a very
simplified way we have an incoming plane wave field </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">&#934;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><sub>i</sub></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">(k_i,r) that scatters off an electron density distribution </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">&#961;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">(r) and produces an outgoing plane wave </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">&#934;<sub>f</sub></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> with wave vector k_f and ||k_k||=||k_i||.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">using the elegant matrix element
notation from quantum mechanics. The matrix element is easy to rewrite
as an integral, and we end up that the scattering is given by the
Fourier transform of the electron density, with the scattering vector
give as q=kf-ki. But for now we will maintain the matrix element, as it
greatly simplifies the next step.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Now, GISAXS operates in reflection
mode, so obviously the Born approximation will give poor results.
However, thing don't have to much get more difficult: the theory and
wave functions of x-ray reflectivity are well known for stratified
media, such as thin films. The reflectivity wave functions are given by</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">&#936;<sub>i,f</sub> = t(kz) &#934;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><sub>i,f</sub></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> + r(kz) &#934;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><sub>i,f</sub></span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
</div>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">t(kz) is the transmission
amplitude into the layer and r(kz) is the reflection from the bottom of
the layer. Here we have already separated of the part of the plane wave
travelling parallel to the interface (x and y directions) and are only
concerned with the part of the wave travelling perpendicular to the
interface. In the semi-infinite substrate there is just a transmitted
wave, and in air |r(kz)|2 yields the x-ray reflectivity signal.<br>
<br>
This ansatz can be solved for each layer and a laterally averaged
electron density analytically using the matrix method - brace yourself,
even for a simply thin film this is already quite a lot of stuff to get
the complex reflection amplitude r(k_r). But let's not get distracted
by the technical demands - the physical interpretation of this formula
is quite straight forward: for each layer we will have an incoming
plane wave and a reflected wave that are superimposed with a fixed
phase relation given by r(k_r). <br>
<br>
If we have only one interface, we will retrieve the well-known Fresnel
formula describing the reflection and refraction of a plane wave at a
planar inteface. Introducing another layer such as a thin film, makes
the whole phenomenology a lot richer: First of all we will get the
Kiessig fringes due to the interference of the waves reflected from the
film surface and the substrate, when the incident angle is above the
critical angles. Inbetween the critical angles and when the film medium
is of lower electron density than the substrate, thing will get even
more interesting: The wave is still strongly reflected by the
substrate, so a standing wave field develops above the substrate. If
the film thickness coincides with a node of the standing wave field, we
obtain a resonance. Under such conditions part of the wave bounces back
and forth inside the film like a wave in a waveguide. Finally, if we
stay below the critical angle of the film, we will have an evanescent
wave in the film, i.e. the amplitude is exponentially attenuated as we
go deeper. In case the resulting "penetration depth" is a good deal
smaller than the film thickness,we can consider the film as effectivly semi-infinite, and obtain depth-sensitive information of the surface-near region. </span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Back to the original task: We need
to ask where in the wave field scattering will occur. If we study
surfaces, we may have regular deposits on the surface - this is the
case for which the popular DWBA software IsGISAXS was originally
developed for.If we study thin films, the waves will get scattered by
the density fluctuations del-rho in the film - remember, in our ansatz
we already solved the exact solution for the laterally averaged
electron density. So for the latter case we can now simply replace the
plan waves with the wave function inside the thin film:</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">I(k_f) =  |&lt;Psi_f | del-rho(r) | Psi_i&gt;|2</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">This is already the essence of
DWBA, and we see that it isw completely analogous to the original Born
approximation, on that we picked wave functions that are better matched
to the problem. Instead of the full electron density, we now have the
density fluctuations. The density fluctuations may be very regular -
for instance domains in a microphase-separated block copolymer. A
regular arrangement of objects will give rise to Bragg reflections The
objects will often also have regular shapes - here enters the form
factor from transmission SAXS.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Now the next step is to consider,
whether we can solve the DWBA formula, and yes, it's going to be messy,
but let's keep in mind that the distorted waves are merely the sum of 2
superimposed plane waves, so just one step more complex. Substituting
the plane waves for the DWs and&nbsp; performing the&nbsp; | |2 will
result in 16 terms. Using the rules for complex numbers, the mixed
terms can by combined, leaving us with 10 terms as shown in detail in a
variety of papers. However, again let's get back to the original matrix
element and let's see whether we can learn something without going
whole hog into the algebra.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">I(k_f) =  |&lt;t(kz) Phi_f + r(kz) Phi_f | del-rho(r) | t(kz) Phi_i + r(kz) Phi_i&gt;|2</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">If the incident angle is about two
times the critical angle of the substrate, r(kz) will be lower than
0.1. At this point the interference of incident and reflected wave can
be neglected, as the reflected wave is too weak to have much of an
effect. This does not hold for the outgoing waves: if we use an area
detector we will see the outgoing scattering intensity in the region of
the critical angles of film and substrate which will create a nicely
shaped Yoneda band with various fringes, depending on the film
thickness. So this we'll get even if there is nothing to scatter from
inside the film! On the other hand, if we chose the incident angle to
be right at a waveguide resonance, the overall scattering signal from
the film will be enhanced. This is particularly useful at the TE0
resonance where we don't have a node inside the film, i.e. the whole
film gets illuminated. The higher resonances can be used for more
sophisticated analysis, however, if we have a weak scatterer and we
want to get the most of it, TE0 is the way to go! The other appealing
thing about TE0 is that it is just a tad above the critical angle of
the film. Right at the critical angle the wave field inside the film is
parallel to the substrate, and at TE0 this is still approximately the
case. Hence we are safe from the notorious "double vision" at somewhat
higher incident angles, where incoming and reflected wave scatter
independently giving rise to a doubling of scattering features along
the surface normal.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">This is about as far as we can go
without torturing the pencil and comprises my usual introduction to
GISAXS for my users. Having a bit of a SAXS background is essential -
remember: the SAXS signal is just the Fourier transform of the electron
density! (But it helps to know a bunch of examples in the corner&nbsp;
of one's mind how simple things scatter - see Lazzari's manual.) To
understand the sometimes confusing dynamic scattering regime inbetween
critical angles, it is essential to have a good grasp on reflectivity
theory. Here we can simplify matters by staying above the critical
angle and go quasi-kinematic. Or hit the TE0 resonance - as long as we are careful to interpret the intensity in the vertical direction with due care.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
