<h1>Rock'n Roll Trouble Shooting</h1>
<h2>Detlef-M. Smilgies, CHESS</h2>
Rock'n Roll refers to the semiautomatic line-up macros for lining-up
samples for grazing incidence scattering and for calibrating the
incident angle.<br>
Rock'n Roll works in over 95% of all line-ups, but occasionally there
can be a problem, either due to a non-ideal sample or an operator error.<br>
<br>
Here is a trouble shooting list<br>
<ol>
  <li>Check whether the shutter was open during the line-up scan; if not, redo line up with shutter open</li>
  <ol>
    <li>you can redo "rock" as many times as needed, but do not repeat "roll"</li>
    <li>if "roll does not work (only noise in the scans, no reflected beam), your sample may have poor x-ray reflectivity</li>
    <li>for poor reflectivity samples run rock a couple of times, and then set "samth" and "samz" to ZERO<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Check in the hutch whether something is blocking the beam<br>
  </li>
  <li>Type "wsam" and compare user values and dial values for motors samz and samth.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>I carefully align the sample stage relative to the beam; these motor positions are saved as "dial" values<br>
    </li>
    <li>if
values differ by more than 10%, use the "set" command to set the motors
to the dial values: set samz &lt;dial value&gt;;set samth &lt;dial
value&gt;<br>
    </li>
    <li>use the "mv" command to move motors to zero: mv samz 0; mv samth 0</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Make sure that you use a proper sample name containing only (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -, _); otherwise an error results</li>
  <ol>
    <li>redo "new" with a proper sample name<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Make sure that you supply the correct sample thickness when using the "new" command</li>
  <li>Check that the shutter is open.</li>
  <li>Run the "rock" and "roll" macros again.</li>
</ol>
If this does not help<br>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the sample and carefully line up the sample holder with "rock"; set "samz" and "samth" to ZERO<br>
</li>
  <li>Does the sample look flat? rough samples are always hard to align, best by hand<br>
  </li>

</ol>
