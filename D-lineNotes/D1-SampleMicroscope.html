Sample Microscope</h1>

Smilgies, CHESS</h2>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Introduction</span></h3>
The
D1 microscope consists of a Navitar motorized zoom and focus module
with on-axis lighting, as well as several front lenses (0.5x, 0.75x, 1x = no lens, 2x) as well as 2 tubes (1x, 2x).
Images are collected by streaming video from the SONY CCD camera. The
system is controlled by the Crystal Centering program developed in the MacCHESS
group (Richard Gillilan, Dave Schuller). <br><br>Note: Most of the features of the
centering software on the bottom control bar features&nbsp;are
currently not used (the spindle rotation is only for crystallography,
the sample x and z translations are currently only supported within
SPEC.)<br><br>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Cabling &amp; re-activation</span></h3>Most of the cabling is already done and componets are kept in the D1 hutch crate.<br><ul><li>connect serial port cable of&nbsp; focus/zoom controller to centering computer</li><li>connect firewire cable of Sony camera to centering computer</li><li>connect power supply of focus/zoom controller</li><li>connect power supply of on-axis lighting controller</li><li>microscope and camera unit should be already wired (focus, zoom, on-axis lighting)</li></ul>For re-activation of the centering system (for instance after CESR-TA run):<br><ul><li>start centering computer</li><li>switch on zfocus/zoom controller</li><li>switch on lighting controller - make sure that light is not set too bright</li></ul>

<h3 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><br></h3><h3 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Starting and using the
CrystalCentering program</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the Linux PC go to the /CrystalCentering directory and
type center_server to start the program.</li>
<li>use the "Zoom" tab to adjust Zoom (with the slider) and
Focus (type value in the box or use the arrows)</li>
<ul>
<li>note: check with beamline&nbsp;staff whether the
microscope is set up to track properly</li>
</ul>
<li>use the "Cam" tab to adjust the brightness and color of the
image&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>"Brightness" uses the computer software to brighten images</li>
<li>"Gain" is the gain of the CCD camera to brighten images</li>
<li>"Shutter Speed" controls the exposure of the camera to
brighten images</li>
<ul>
<li>if Speed is set too slow, images will be blurry when
the sample moves</li>
</ul>
<li>"White Bal UB" and "White Bal VR" affect the color of the
images</li>
<li>the on-axis lighting currently cannot be controlled
remotely - use the manual control box in the hutch</li>
</ul>
<li>"Save Photos" in the top menu bar enables saving of
microscope images</li>
<ul>
<li>only the "single snap" option is currently supported</li>
</ul>
<li>"Visual Aids" in the top menu bar toggles the crosshair and
the scale bar on and off</li>
<li>"Admin Only" in the top menu bar enables line-up features</li>
<ul>
<li>"Set Crosshair" plus doubeclick moves the crosshair to a
new location</li>
<li>"Midpoint Tool" determines the center between 2 spots
vertically&nbsp; (doubleclick on each spot)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Calibrating the
microscope</h3>
NOTE: this part is for beamline staff and expert users only<br>
<br>
The CrystalCentering program, as used at D1, has 5 calibration
parameters which are found in conf/server.properties.<br>
When changing a value, the program needs to be restarted.<br>
<ul>
<li>zcenX, zcenY or the coordinates of the invariant point
under zoom</li>
<li>beamDiameter defines the diameter of the crosshair
circle&nbsp;in microns</li>
<li>zoomSlope and zoomIntercept are used to calibrate the
onscreen pixels to microns</li>
</ul>
<h4>Calibration procedures</h4>
<ul>
<li>pixel coordinates and zoom and focus values</li>
<ul>
<li>on the main directory type "tail -f center.log" - this
will provide
zoom, and focus values as well as the pixel position of the crosshair
when you use the midpoint tool</li>
<li>(the "tail" command displays the last 20 lines of the
logfile and updates automatically)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>finding the invariant point (R. Gillilan)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>using a test object on the xyz sample stage find a sharp
feature, such as the tip of a needle</li>
<li>estimate the invariant point from the previous position
of simply the center of the screen</li>
<li>zoom in and put the needle tip into the crosshair</li>
<li>zoom out and move the crosshair to the needle tip</li>
<li>iterate step 3 and 4 until the crosshair remains on the
needle tip for all zoom values</li>
<li>update zcenX and zcenY and restart the centering program.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">note: this procedure needs
to be repeated, whenever the microscope is remounted, or lenses, tubes
or cameras have been changed<br>
</div>
<ul>
<li>calibration (R. Gillilan)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>zoomSlope and zooIntercept are determined in a graph
&nbsp;log(pixels/micron) versus zoom units</li>
<li>use a calibrated test grid for calibration (R. Gillilan
has an electron microscope scale which works great)</li>
<li>if
the the in-line mirror is used the calibration needs to be done both in
x and z. samth should be aligned such that the x and z values for
pixels/micron agree</li>
<li>for every change of the optics the microscope needs to be
recalibtrated.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
