<br>
Using single-bounce x-ray focusing capillaries from Don Bilderback's
group, we can focus the D1 beam down to 20 microns. The beam divergence
can be limited by accepting only a part of the accepted annulus by
using a set of slits upstream of the capillary (see Ruipeng Li et al,
J. Synchrotron Rad ...).<br>
<br>
We are developing a capillary stage that can be moved into the beamline
relatively easily . Working distance, i.e. distance from capillary tip
to sample is typically 55 mm for the 8 mrad capillary.<br>
<br>
A far-field camera, about 500mm from the sample is used to align the sample (see Sterling Cornaby, Capillary handbook(<br>
<br>
Essential for work in grazing incidence is our polished Cd tungstate
crystal and the sample microscope; this way the focused beam can be
characterized in situ.<br>
<br>
Microbeam scattering is still considered to be an expert technique at
D1. Hence users requesting this option must be willing to devote a
larger part of their beamtime for line-up and to gain expertise in
re-aligning the capillary.<br>
