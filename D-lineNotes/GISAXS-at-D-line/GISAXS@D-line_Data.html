<h1><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><big><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">GISAXS @ D-line: Data</span></big></span></small></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Q: Where
are my data ?</span></h2>
Each D-line user gets a user directory assigned on <span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/specuser/USER</span>, where <span style="font-family: monospace;">USER </span>corresponds to the name
of the PI of the experiment. USER has the following default
subdirectories:<br>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">data</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">corr</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">dark</li>
</ul>
The <span style="font-family: monospace;">data </span>directory
contains the <span style="font-family: monospace;">SPEC </span>output
files. These are all line-up and reflectivity scans, all appended to
one file <span style="font-family: monospace;">FILENAME</span>, the
name of which is declared in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">newfile
</span>command. This file contains other important information, such as
all motor positions at the beginning of each scan or CCD exposure
(which corresponds to a <span style="font-family: monospace;">tseries </span>scan
in <span style="font-family: monospace;">SPEC</span>)
and the count
rates of all monitor detectors along the beamline. The log file is in
ASCII and can be read by any decent text editor, e.g. "gedit", "emacs",
or "vi" (LINUX) or "notepad++"&nbsp; and "MS Word" (Windows).<br>
<br>
<span style="color: red;"></span><br>
The <span style="font-family: monospace;">corr </span>and <span style="font-family: monospace;">dark </span>directories contain all
your images, the automatically corrected ones in <span style="font-family: monospace;">corr</span>, the dark images in <span style="font-family: monospace;">dark</span>. Data format is TIFF.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/specuser/images</span>
directory contains all raw data files that
the CCD
collects. At the end of a user experiment
<span style="font-family: monospace;">~/images</span> can be copied
to <span style="font-family: monospace;">USER/raw</span>, if users
would like to keep the raw images:<br>
<ul>
  <li>cd ~/images</li>
  <li>mv *.tif ~/[user]/raw</li>
</ul>Otherwise, raw images will be removed to make space for the next
user
group. According to new NSF guidelines on scientific ethics, old data
files need to be stored at CHESS. At present the archiving procedure is
not yet defined; for the time being corrected files and log files are
being kept on the acquisition computer and the analysis PC.<br>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Q: How do I
take my data home ?</span></h2>The following
procedure has proven to be solid:<br>
<ul>
  <li>when you come to CHESS make sure to bring a flash drive (8G) or an external hard disk (USB)<br>
</li>
  <li>go to the CHESS User Computer Room and mount your drive using the USB extension ports <br>
  </li>

  <li>use the "ssh Secure File Transfer" program to directly copy the data to your disk</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Alternatively you can&nbsp; copy to the hard disk of you laptop -
there are
plenty of high-speed ethernet connections in the Computer Room and
there is a local wireless network. Using the letter you can directly
mount the hard disk of the acquisition computer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

  <li>Because of the large amount of data produced by the area
detector, I discourage the use of the <span style="font-family: monospace;">CD </span>or <span style="font-family: monospace;">DVD </span>burners.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DO NOT</span> try to hook up
external storage devices to the beamline computer - it is too easy to
crash <span style="font-family: monospace;">LINUX </span>this way and
make a huge mess.</li>
  <li>Access to CHESS beamline computers from the outside has been disabled.<br>
  </li>

</ul>

<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Q: How do I
set up a lap top at D-line ?</span></h2>
The easiest and most reliable way is to connect the lap top to an
ethernet connector (there are 2 user ports at the desk top and 1 at the
prep table) and choose
"find address automatically". No special password is required. Please
do not hook up lap tops to the ethernet switch connecting the beamline computer
and the CCD computer.<br>
<br>
The Wilson Lab wireless network requires a password. Please contact the
CHESS Operator for assistance. Despite
the metal hutch walls, the wireless works reasonable in the beamline control area.<br>
