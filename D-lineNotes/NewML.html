For radiography the vertical beamsize should be as large as possible. A
set of 4" x 1" multilayers with a d-spacing of 29.8A was installed in
the D-line mono in August 2004. Material is Mo:B4C which has a better
reflectivity in the 10-15keV range than W-based multilayers. A new set
of holders was designed and sent for manufacture by Alan Pauling which
became available in week 3 of the July 2004 run, just in time for
experiments.<br>

InGa alloy.<br>

Both multilayers were prealigned with a water level, and the Bragg
reflection was found quickly. <br>
The first multilayer already shows some discoloration, trademark of the
He environment in the mono box.<br>

For completeness a picture of the white beam slits, which were rebrazed
and cleaned by Jim Savino <br>
just before the run, in order to fix a water leak.<br>
