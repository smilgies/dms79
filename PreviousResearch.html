&nbsp;
    <p>In the small romantic city of G&ouml;ttingen, nowadays right in
the
heart of Germany, I took my first fledgeling steps in science, studying
physics and maths at the Georgia Augusta. The Georgia Augusta is a
moderately
young university founded in the mid 1700's by a king of Hannover of
same
name. Unusual at the time was the strong focus on the hard sciences and
the university of G&ouml;ttingen has seen such eminent mathematicians
and
physicists as Carl-Friedrich Gau&szlig;, Felix Klein, David Hilbert,
Richard Courant, and Emmy Noether,
as well as Wilhelm Weber, James Franck, and Max Born in the past two
hundred years. Nowadays the university is a
public
school (no tuition!) with 35,000 students. Student life in
G&ouml;ttingen
is famous for the numerous student pubs, many of them located in
historic
old basements like Blue Note, Trou, Theaterkeller, to name a few of my
old favorite hang-outs. </p>
    <p>For my undergraduate and graduate thesis projects I joined the
group
of J. Peter Toennies at the Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r
Str&ouml;mungsforschung,
right across the street from the Physics Institute. Working in Ekkehard
Hulpke&#8217;s lab, I learned to deal with ultra-high vacuum equipment and
surface
preparation. The ultimate research tool in the Toennies Group were
ultrasonic
beams of thermal <a href="has/HeliumAtomBeams.html">helium atoms</a>
that
can be scattered from molecules, surfaces, and atom clusters. I used
helium
scattering to measure atom diffraction patterns and surface phonons. My
thesis project was to study the structure and dynamics of the
reconstruction
of the clean molybdenum(001) surface. In the course of my studies I
could
show
that the molly surface reconstruction was correlated with the softening
of a surface phonon [<a href="refs/molly1.pdf">1</a>], [<a
 href="refs/molly2.pdf">2</a>],
and that the reconstruction was high-order commensurate [<a
 href="refs/molly3.pdf">3</a>]. Due to the high reactivity of the molly
surface, especially with regard to hydrogen, such studies are a major
tour de force in vacuum science. </p>
    <p>Still curious about the molly reconstruction, I joined Ian
Robinson
at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, in order to learn about surface x-ray
diffraction,
which has been my field of study ever since. Working with Ian and Peter
Eng at beamline X16A at the National Synchrotron Light
Source,
it took two blood-sweat-and-tears experiments to finally observe the
molly
reconstruction.
We found that Mo(001) features the peculiar zig-zag reconstruction
known
from W(001), however, the zig-zag chains are interspersed with periodic
anti-phase domain boundaries [<a href="refs/molly5.pdf">4</a>] yielding
the high-order commensurate structure. The greatest things about living
in Eastern Long Island were the ocean beaches, hiking on the Forks, and
contra-dancing at Smithtown. And there I met Melanie ... </p>
    <p>The first successes got me hooked to synchrotron radiation and
decided
to extend my stay. I found a follow-up postdoc position at Rutgers with
Jane Hinch. Here we had two projects: building a new helium atom beam
spectrometer
at Rutgers and studying the etching of silicon surfaces with HF and
buffered
HF solutions in-situ exploiting surface x-ray diffraction at
Brookhaven. </p>
    <p>After Rutgers I accepted a postdoctoral position with Robert
Feidenhans&#8217;l
and Mourits Nielsen at Ris&oslash; National Lab in Denmark. I joined
the
group at a very productive phase with multiple collaborations and a
large diversity
of research projects, for instance surfaces of organic crystals [5],
electrochemistry
[6] and studies of laser-deposited thin films of high-T<sub>c</sub>
superconductors
[7]. Apart from these projects that were covering new grounds in the
Ris&oslash;
group at the time, structure determination of so-called deep
reconstructions
on semiconductor surfaces was the main research effort. In such
systems,
the reconstruction at the surface, either by itself or induced by
adsorbtion
of a metal atom, results in distortions of the semiconductor lattice
over
several successive layers. A nice example - and a very hard nut to
crack
- presented the c(2x8) reconstruction of the InSb(001) surface [<a
 href="refs/insb.pdf">8</a>].
So every couple of weeks we packed up our stationwagon and took the
5-hour
trip to the Ris&oslash; diffractometer at HASYLAB's BW2 beamline, to
take
another data set on samples expertly prepared by Robert Johnson and his
students at HASYLAB. </p>
    <p>During this time, a project very dear to my heart was in-situ
sputtering
of a germanium(001) surface [<a href="refs/Ge-sputter.pdf">9</a>]. The
non-equilibrium roughening dynamics of this surface features a dramatic
change in surface signal at a sharp transition temperature. The project
was a collaboration with my fellow-postdocs Peter Eng (AT&amp;T) and
Erik
Landemark (Ris&oslash;) as well as Mourits Nielsen and we were among
the
first users of the Surface Diffraction Beamline (ID3) of the ESRF. </p>
    <p>The greatest Danish achievement of all, for Melanie and me, was
the
birth of our son Max. Right at the beginning of the hot summer of&nbsp;
1995, the summer of the red poppy fields, just after sunrise ... If you
ever think, you are a tough synchrotron scientist, and can run night
shifts
without end, wait until your first baby is born ... </p>
    <p>The European Mecca of synchrotron radiation science, the ESRF,
should become my next employer: I got hired as a beamline
scientist
in the Tro&iuml;ka-Group (ID10), to build the second branch of
Tro&iuml;ka.
Gerhard Gr&uuml;bel, Andreas Freund, and Jens Als-Nielsen had pioneered
the idea of utilizing an x-ray transparent single crystal of diamond as
a beam splitter, in order to multiplex an undulator beamline into
multiple
independent stations. The <a href="esrf/troika2.html">Troika II</a>
station
was to be a multi-purpose x-ray scattering beamline for the
study of liquid and solid surfaces. </p>
    <p>Inspired by the Troika II misson, I shifted my own field of
interest
to
organic thin films, when the beamline first became operative. Organic
thin
films is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field with applications
in physics, materials science, and chemistry, and reaching into biology
and medicine. The in-house research program at ID10B was carried by me
and three postdocs, Nathalie Boudet, Bernd Struth, and Oleg Konovalov.
As my first steps into this new field I started out with something that
felt somewhat familiar to me with my solid state background: thin
crystalline
films of electroluminescent molecules, as are of interest in molecular
electronics applications such as organic light-emitting diodes or
lasers
and organic transistors. I developed grazing-incidence diffraction
techniques
to study the microstructure of such films which feature 3D growth and
are
charactrized by small crystallites with preferential orientations [<a
 href="refs/popop.pdf">10</a>, <a href="refs/kintzel.pdf">11</a>]. </p>
    <p>Becoming more adventurous, I started looking into nanoparticles
on glass
and on the water surface as well as into monolayers on GaAs and silver
films. A special challenge
was the development of the high-resolution grazing-incidence
small-angle
scattering (GISAXS) technique which yielded very nice first results on
properties
of ultrathin polymer films, extending my point of view from the
&Aring;ngstr&oslash;m
scale to mesoscopic scales of several 100 nm [<a href="refs/gutmann.pdf">12</a>,
    <a href="refs/mueller-buschbaum.pdf">13</a>]. The initial Troika II
research program featured a close
interaction
of instrument development and scientific applications and evolved in
close
collaboration with the beamline postdocs, collaborators, and the ID10B
User Community within two very intense and exciting years. I am
indebted
to all persons involved. An account of experimental achievements at
ID10B
was given in various contributions at the workshop &#8220;Surface Science
2000:
Self-Organization at Interfaces and in Thin Films&#8221; at ESRF in February
2000 [<a href="refs/surf2000-announcement.htm">14</a>] and later
summarized in an instrumentation paper [14a]. </p>
    <p>With one year left on my ESRF contract, I started looking into
new options.
I chose to accept an offer to work as a senior staff scientist on
constructing
G-line with Joel Brock and Alan Pauling at Cornell University. G-line
features
a new 50 pole wiggler at Cornell&#8217;s CESR storage ring, supplying three
experimental
hutches simultaneously with intense x-ray beams. G-line was built on an
NSF grant by a group of researchers from within Cornell faculty and
supplies
primarily beamtime to these groups. The first batch of Cornell students
received
hands-on
training in designing and building beamline components and
instrumentation
needed for their research. A&nbsp; first comprehensive overview of
current
research
projects was presented recently at the workshop &#8220;Science at Cornell&#8217;s
G-line"
in November 2000 [<a href="G-lineWorkshop.html">15</a>]. Essential for
this ambitious research program was the development of the
high-flux
beamline optics based on fucosed multilayer beams, as pioneered by
Randy Headrick and coworkers at CHESS A2. <br>
    </p>
    <p>My own
research
efforts on the microstructure characterization of organic thin films
continued
at various CHESS beamlines. A break-through GISAXS study revealed
detailed insights in lamellar thin films of diblock copolymers [15a]. I
also continued my collaboration with Ed Kintzel to study the adsorption
of phenylenes on alkali halide surfaces, a continuation of studies I
had started at ESRF. At G2 station chemistry student Daniel Blasini and
I built a
grazing-incidence reciprocal space mapping set-up, in its latest
incarnation comprising a psi-circle kappa diffractometer and a 100 mm
gas detector with matching Soller collimator [16]. We have been able to
characterize a variety of different types of "real" surfaces such as 3D
powders of device-grade amorphous organic semicondutors&nbsp; [17],
polycrystalline materials on fuel cell electrode surfaces [18], 2D
powders in organic crystals and Langmuir-Blodgett films
[16], and single crystalline samples of small molecules on alkali
halide surfaces [19].<br>
    </p>
    <p>In 2004, after installation of the G-line main optics, I
accepted to switch over to CHESS D-line. After 4 years of beamline
construction, and adopting baby Mauro with my wife in 2003, I was ready
for less operations responsibilities and more research. Nonetheless,
under my lead D-line
was gradually completely renovated - motion control system, hutch
instrumentation (2nd optical table, ISO-100 modular flight path),
cabling, and
control area - while maintaining a full user load. I managed to develop
the CHESS GISAXS user community [20-24] and have gotten recently into
GIWAXS, which nicely complements the GID system
at G2 - less resolution, but quicker data acquisition. The latest facet
of D-line developments is scattering of microbeams making use of the
in-house x-ray capillaries developed by Don Bilderback's group [25].
This project was started to gain experience with future scattering
technologies, as required for the Cornell Energy-Recovery Linac project
(ERL).<br>
