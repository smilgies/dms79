<b><font size="+2">Homopolymer Thin Films</font></b>
<p>We want to get an overview of the effects of surface energy and
entropy
on the morphology of a polymer thin film.
<br>
First we will look at a homopolymer, inspired by a study by van der
Lee [van der Lee], and then see which
<br>
of these considereations play a role for block copolymer films.

</p>
<p>A polymer film differs from the infinitely extended bulk in that it
has two interfaces: the air-film-interface and the film-substrate
interface.
Let's start with the first interface:
</p>
<p>The air-film interface is dominated by the surface energy or surface
tension of the polymer. The surface energy is the amount of energy
needed
to bring a polymer chain to the surface. Since coordination and
entanglement
are always reduced for a polymer chain at the surface, there is always
energy needed and never gained to get the chain to the surface. In this
respect the surface acts like a repulsive wall. However, the air-film
interface
is not rigid like a real wall, and the film surface does not have to be
flat, as for instance in dewetting processes. Finally the air-film
interface
is the connection of the film with the outside world, and in particular
diffusion processes of solvents may induce a kinetic structuring due to
concentration gradients in the surface layers.
</p>
<p>The film-substrate interface can be thought of as a hard wall, which
may be attractive or repulsive. There are many subtle effects that are
of importance in the interface region of the polymer material close to
the wall:
</p>
<p>Attractive Wall
<br>
- increase of Tg
<br>
- increase of monomer density at wall
</p>
<p>Wall entropy
<br>
- chain-wall interaction: surface adhesion
<br>
- chain conformation: distorted coil shape (oblate) -&gt; increased
segment
density
<br>
- loss of configurational entropy: decrease in monomer density,
depletion
region
<br>
- chain orientation: orient parallel to reduce orientational entropy
<br>
- surface segregation of stiffer segments
</p>
<p>Repulsive Wall
<br>
- lowering of Tg
<br>
- disentanglement
<br>
- confinement

of remaining solvent
